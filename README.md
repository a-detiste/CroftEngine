## Credits

The following people did extensive work on the [OpenTomb engine](http://opentomb.github.io/), which was
the starting point for EdisonEngine.  Although EdisonEngine is a complete re-write with negligible
remnants of OpenTomb's code base and pretty much different goals, you can see the commit history of
OpenTomb in this repository.  Because of that - and because I want to be grateful - I'd like to give credit
to the OpenTomb contributors.

## Building

Do a `git submodule update --init --recursive`.

EdisonEngine uses [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg); refer to its documentation for basic usage,
but the only thing you need is to call cmake with
`-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/devel/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake` (adjust path as necessary).

This is the list of the required libraries to be installed with `vcpkg install` (remember to
set the target triplet as necessary, e.g. `vcpkg install boost:x64-windows`):
* boost
* glfw3
* libpng
* openal-soft
* opengl
* glm
* zlib
* libsndfile
* freetype
* sol2
* cimg
* ffmpeg
* glew
* utfcpp
* python3
* ryml

...or use this, and adjust the triplet:
> `vcpkg install --triplet x64-windows boost glfw3 libpng openal-soft opengl glm zlib libsndfile freetype sol2 cimg ffmpeg glew utfcpp python3 ryml`
